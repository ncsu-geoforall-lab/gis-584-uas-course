## Outline

- Motivation for time series data acquisition
- UAS-based monitoring survey design
- Processing UAS data time series, temporal data framework
- Basic analysis of 3D data time series, volumes 
- Dynamic visualization of time series
- Applications in crop monitoring, viewsheds 




## UAS for monitoring changes

Low cost and rapid deployment: excellent for monitoring changes at local scale (fields, small watersheds)

- crop monitoring: growth, disease, stress
- erosion processes: coastal, stream bank, rills and gullies
- natural disasters: flooding, landslides, fire
- mining, construction sites




## Monitoring design

#### Assess:

- metrics to quantify changes: relative height, volume, feature migration
- spatial resolution needed to capture the changes
- temporal resolution: regular intervals, events
- accessibility: flying over people, line of sight, suitable GCPs
- georeferencing, rectification: GCPs distribution and survey


## Processing time series

- analyze and interpolate point clouds: DSMs with aligned, common resolution grids
- raster DSMs are more suitable for time series than TIN
- use GCPs and permanent features to evaluate accuracy, correct errors and distortions
- assign time stamps and register raster DSMs within GIS-based temporal data framework


## Temporal data framework {.smaller}

- supports efficient processing, management and analysis of space-time data sets
- space-time dataset is a set of maps (raster, vector) registered in a temporal database
- space-time dataset may represent a dynamic process 
- individual maps represent the states of the dynamic system at a given time

## Time stamp type {.smaller}

- time stamp: assigns time to an individual map in space-time data set
- time instant - snapshot at given time: 2013-10-15 13:00:00 (absolute time)
- time interval - defined by start and end time: day, month, year (relative time)
- a single UAS survey represents a snapshot (state) which can be agreggated into intervals

## Registered time series

Timeline tool: time and spatial extent of registered maps

![](../images/uas2015_timeline.webp)


## Temporal plot

- Plot time series of elevation values at a given location

![](../images/tplots.webp)


## Temporal count and intersection {.smaller}

- Count: number of maps (temporal snapshots) where the given cell has non-null value (overlap)
- Intersection: grid cells with non-null values from each map in time series

![](../images/series_overlap_count.webp){width=45%}
![](../images/intersection.webp){width=45%}


## Temporal aggregation

- Temporally aggregate maps over a given period of time - for example to derive monthly average elevation

![](../images/aggregated_sept.webp){width=75%}

## Basic time series analysis {.smaller}

Per cell statistics computed for each cell over the time series:

- Mean and standard deviation
- Min, max elevation and range
- Time at minimum, time at maximum
- Linear regression: slope, offset, regression coefficient

## Basic time series analysis: core, envelope

- Core surface: min. elevation measured for each cell
- Envelope: max. elevation measured for each cell

Example: cutting plane with lidar, core and envelope

![](../images/cutplane1.webp){width=47%}
![](../images/cutplane2.webp){width=47%}

## Detecting surveys with large distortions {.smaller}

- Derive core surface from UAS time series
- Compute difference between UAS core and lidar bare ground surface
- Compute time of minimum raster to identify the distorted DSMs with elevation well below lidar bare ground

![](../images/diff_lid_uasmin.webp){width=47%}
![](../images/minraster.webp){width=47%}

## Corrected UAS core surface {.smaller}

- Remove distorted DSMs from derivation of core surface
- Difference between UAS core and lidar bare ground surface is now very small
- Hist. equalized color ramp for differences highlights a small shift in lidar swath

## Envelope and range applications {.smaller}

- Envelope: what is the max height of crop in each pixel over the monitored period?
- Time of maximum - when was the crop highest at each grid cell?
- Where is the largest range and variability in crop height?

![](../images/diff_lid_uasmax.webp){width=40%}
![](../images/max2.webp){width=40%}

## Envelope and range applications

- Use envelope to show all cars ever parked at the site
- Core, snapshot, envelope, surfaces can be used to manage parking area

![](../images/cars.webp){width=50%}

## Basic time series analysis: regression

- Applies to well designed, systematic monitoring with longer time series
- Select subset where the changes are close to linear - e.g. crop growth period
- Compute per cell linear regression analysis: map of regression slope and offset

## Map algebra for time series

- Apply map algebra expression for each map in the time series at each grid cell
- Output is new time series which is registered as a new space-time dataset
- This is different (and much simpler) from temporal map algebra

## Extract crop height time series {.smaller}

Map algebra can be used to extract grid cells with elevation above lidar bare ground within a selected elevation interval (z1,z2)

*Maps of relative elevation (0.3m, 2.0m) above bare ground lidar for 3 time snapshots in our time series. The middle map shows distortions rather than crop.*

## Estimate crop volume

Summary statistics can be used to estimate above ground crop biomass

![](../images/cutplane1.webp){width=70%}

## Estimate volume of structures

- Compute volume based on difference between bare ground and above ground feature, such as building

![](../images/cutplane2.webp){width=70%}

## Analysis: Viewsheds {.smaller}

Evaluate influence of vegetation on the viewshed area

![](../images/Anna_viewshed.webp){height=380}

*Spatial extent of viewshed changes over time depending on the height of surrounding vegetation, different colors show the spatial extent of viewshed at different times*

## Analysis: Viewsheds {.smaller}

Provide analysis to support siting of a monitoring webcam

*Spatial extent of viewshed changes over time depending on the height of surrounding vegetation*

## Dynamic visualization {.smaller}

- We covered the basics in the flow modeling example
