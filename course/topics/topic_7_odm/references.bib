  abstract     = {Photogrammetry is experiencing its renaissance in the 21st century. The main driving forces are research in computer vision as well as drone ({UAV}/{UAS}/{RPAS}) technology. There are popular open-source libraries and applications available in these fields (e.g. {OpenCV} and {ODM}). In this paper, we report our experiments using {OpenCV} in specific land surveying projects. Our efforts concentrate on two areas. The first one is the application of close-range photogrammetry for deformation observations. Fitting a simple camera to the eyepiece of a total station we reached sub millimetre movement detection from few meters. This method was used for dynamic test load of a bridge and a floating platform. The second area is automatic ground control point ({GCP}) detection in images taken from drones. Optimizing the size and colours of the used {ArUco} markers we achieved nearly 100 percent results in different light conditions.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing is revolutionizing the phenotyping of agricultural field trials, but for many researchers, the extraction of plot-level results is a bottleneck. We have developed the R package {FIELDimageR} as a user-friendly tool to analyze orthomosaic images containing many plots. The basic workflow involves cropping and rotating the image, followed by the creation of a shapefile based on the experimental design. The package includes functions to calculate the number of plants per plot, canopy cover percentage, vegetation indices, and plant height. {FIELDimageR} is publicly available as a {GitHub} repository (https://github.com/filipematias23/{FIELDimageR}).},

  abstract     = {{FieldimageR}.Extra is an advanced R package that enhances user experience and computational efficiency in analyzing orthomosaic images from agricultural field trials. Through the integration of modern {GIS} libraries like terra, stars, and sf, it surpasses traditional packages like raster and sp. The {FieldimageR}.Extra offers interactive visualization, vector feature creation, and spatial data editing within the R environment through the integration of mapview and mapedit packages. Notably, {FieldimageR}.Extra introduces new functions like {fieldShape}\_render and {fieldShape}\_edit, enabling flexible plot grid generation and editing capabilities. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of {FieldimageR}.Extra in handling spatial data, crop and extract operations, and plot grid generation. With its comprehensive features, {FieldimageR}.Extra stands as a valuable addition to the {FieldimageR} R package, offering researchers efficient tools for unmanned aerial vehicle-based orthomosaic image analysis in agricultural research. {FIELDimageR}.Extra is publicly available as a {GitHub} repository (https://github.com/filipematias23/{FIELDimageR}.Extra).},
