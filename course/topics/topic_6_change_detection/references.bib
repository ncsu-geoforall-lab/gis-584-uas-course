	abstract = {Otsu’s method is a classic thresholding approach in image segmentation. While the two-dimensional (2D) Otsu’s method performs better than the original one in segmenting images corrupted by noise, it is sensitive to Salt\&Pepper noise. In order to solve this problem, we present a robust 2D Otsu’s thresholding method in this paper. Our method builds the 2D histogram based on the image smoothed by both median and average filters, in contrast to the traditional method using averaged image only. Then the optimal threshold vector is determined with two one-dimensional searches on the two dimensions of the 2D histogram. In addition, we introduce a region post-processing step to deal with the pixels of noise and edges. Compared with the traditional 2D Otsu’s method, our method improves the robustness to Salt\&Pepper noise and Gaussian noise significantly. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images validate the effectiveness of the proposed {MAOTSU}\_2D method.},

	abstract = {This report outlines quality assurance ({QA}) processes, including radiometric and geometric calibration guidelines, and guidelines for data acquisition and quality control to be followed by U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) researchers for acquiring and processing uncrewed aircraft systems ({UAS}) data. These {QA} processes ensure that {UAS} data can be used for quantitative analysis and are comparable with other standard geospatial data.Remote sensing data play a critical role in monitoring Earth’s resources. Traditionally, the {USGS} and Department of the Interior have used well calibrated metric sensors mounted on satellite or aircraft platforms to collect these data. These sensors and platforms are stable, and data have been processed using standard pipelines. These processes ensured that the data are generally consistent with each other and benefitted a diverse group of users. These data are shared among multiple researchers around the world through the internet and other means, using standard formats and metadata.In the last...},

	abstract = {There are an increasing number of digital elevation models ({DEMs}) available worldwide for deriving elevation differences over time, including vertical changes on glaciers. Most of these {DEMs} are heavily post-processed or merged, so that physical error modelling becomes difficult and statistical error modelling is required instead. We propose a three-step methodological framework for assessing and correcting {DEMs} to quantify glacier elevation changes: (i) remove {DEM} shifts, (ii) check for elevation-dependent biases, and (iii) check for higher-order, sensor-specific biases. A simple, analytic and robust method to co-register elevation data is presented in regions where stable terrain is either plentiful (case study New Zealand) or limited (case study Svalbard). The method is demonstrated using the three global elevation data sets available to date, {SRTM}, {ICESat} and the {ASTER} {GDEM}, and with automatically generated {DEMs} from satellite stereo instruments of {ASTER} and {SPOT}5-{HRS}. After 3-D co-registration, significant biases related to elevation were found in some of the stereoscopic {DEMs}. Biases related to the satellite acquisition geometry (along/cross track) were detected at two frequencies in the automatically generated {ASTER} {DEMs}. The higher frequency bias seems to be related to satellite jitter, most apparent in the back-looking pass of the satellite. The origins of the more significant lower frequency bias is uncertain. {ICESat}-derived elevations are found to be the most consistent globally available elevation data set available so far. Before performing regional-scale glacier elevation change studies or mosaicking {DEMs} from multiple individual tiles (e.g. {ASTER} {GDEM}), we recommend to co-register all elevation data to {ICESat} as a global vertical reference system.},

@book{segal_generalized-icp_2009,
	title = {Generalized-{ICP}},
	abstract = {In this paper we combine the Iterative Closest Point ('{ICP}') and 'point-to-plane {ICP}' algorithms into a single probabilistic framework. We then use this framework to model locally planar surface structure from both scans instead of just the "model" scan as is typically done with the point-to-plane method. This can be thought of as 'plane-to-plane'. The new approach is tested with both simulated and real-world data and is shown to outperform both standard {ICP} and point-to-plane. Furthermore, the new approach is shown to be more robust to incorrect correspondences, and thus makes it easier to tune the maximum match distance parameter present in most variants of {ICP}. In addition to the demonstrated performance improvement, the proposed model allows for more expressive probabilistic models to be incorporated into the {ICP} framework. While maintaining the speed and simplicity of {ICP}, the Generalized-{ICP} could also allow for the addition of outlier terms, measurement noise, and other probabilistic techniques to increase robustness.

	abstract = {High-resolution image registration is an important task in remote sensing image processing. In this paper, an automatic and robust local feature-based image registration approach is proposed for high-resolution remote sensing images. The proposed method consists of four main steps. In the first step, an integrated local feature-based matching method based on an improved speeded-up robust features ({SURF}) detector and an adaptive binning scale-invariant feature transform ({AB}-{SIFT}) descriptor is developed for fast, dense and robust tie-point extraction. In the second step, a localized graph transformation matching ({LGTM}) method is developed for reliable mismatch elimination. In the third step, an advanced oriented least square matching ({OLSM}) method is applied to improve the positional accuracy of the refined tie-points. Finally, the input image is warped using an appropriate transformation model. To investigate the impact of the transformation function, the capability of some models, including, polynomials of degrees 2 to 4, piecewise linear ({PL}), weighted mean ({WM}) and multiquadric ({MQ}) are compared. The proposed method has been evaluated with five pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images from {IRS}-P5, {SPOT} 5, {SPOT} 6, {IKONOS}, Geoeye, Quickbird, and Worldview sensors, and the registration results demonstrate its robustness and capability. The {MATLAB} code of the proposed method can be downloaded from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320354469\_HRImReg.},

	abstract = {Multitemporal sets of lidar data provide a unique opportunity to analyze and quantify changes in topography in rapidly evolving landscapes. Methodology for geospatial analyses of lidar data time series was developed to investigate patterns of coastal terrain evolution, including the beach and dune systems. The diverse lidar-point data density, noise, and systematic errors were first quantified, and the results were used to compute a consistent series of high-resolution digital elevation models using spline-based approximation with optimized parameters. Raster-based statistical analysis was applied to the elevation-model time series to derive maps representing multiyear trends in spatial patterns of elevation change, to quantify dynamics at each cell using standard deviation maps, and to extract the core surface below which the elevation has never decreased. The methodology was applied to a North Carolina barrier island that was mapped by a sequence of 13 lidar surveys during the past decade, using several different lidar systems. Assessment of vertical differences between the lidar data sets using stable structures such as a road, was shown to be essential for correct quantification of coastal terrain change and its pattern. The analysis revealed the highly dynamic nature of foredunes, the trend toward inland sand transport, and the impact of anthropogenic sand disposal on that trend.},

	abstract = {As rapid urbanization occurs in cities worldwide, the importance of maintaining updated digital elevation models ({DEM}) will continue to increase. However, due to the cost of generating high-resolution {DEM} over large spatial extents, the temporal resolution of {DEMs} is coarse in many regions. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAS}) and {DEM} data fusion provide a partial solution to improving the temporal resolution of {DEM} but do not identify which areas of a {DEM} require updates. We present Rapid-{DEM}, a framework that identifies and prioritizes locations with a high likelihood of an urban topographic change to target {UAS} data acquisition and fusion to provide up-to-date {DEM}. The framework uses {PlanetScope} 3 m satellite imagery, Google Earth Engine, and {OpenStreetMap} for land cover classification. {GRASS} {GIS} generates a contextualized priority queue from the land cover data and outputs polygons for {UAS} flight planning. Low-cost {UAS} fly the identified areas, and {WebODM} generates a {DEM} from the {UAS} survey data. The {UAS} data is fused with an existing {DEM} and uploaded to a public data repository. To demonstrate Rapid-{DEM} a case study in the Walnut Creek Watershed in Wake County, North Carolina is presented. Two land cover classification models were generated using random forests with an overall accuracy of 89\% (kappa 0.86) and 91\% (kappa 0.88). The priority queue identified 109 priority locations representing 1.5\% area of the watershed. Large forest clearings were the highest priority locations, followed by newly constructed buildings. The highest priority site was a 0.5 km2 forest clearing that was mapped with {UAS}, generating a 15 cm {DEM}. The {UAS} {DEM} was resampled to 3 m resolution and fused with {USGS} {NED} 1/9 arc-second {DEM} data. Surface water flow was simulated over the original and updated {DEM} to illustrate the impact of the topographic change on flow patterns and highlight the importance of timely {DEM} updates.},
