## Objectives

::: {.incremental}

- Phases of flight planning
- Safety procedures and checklists
- Ground Control Points and its distirbution and accuracy
- Flight planning software

:::

---

## Pre-flight Considerations

![](../images/photogrammetric_process.webp)

Throughout the whole process, it is important to remember:

- What is the aim of the project?
- What is the required resolution?
- Flight regulations
- Weather

---

## Project Definition

![](../images/flowchart_project.webp)

- Define spatial scale (spatial resolution and extent)
- Choosing UAS and sensor
- Assessing the cost, labor, and time consumption
- Collecting information about terrain

---

## Project Definition

![](../images/flowchart_project.webp)

- Define the area and resolution based on:
  - UAS and sensor capabilities
  - Spatial extent of the mapping area
  - Terrain constraints
  - Project requirements

---

## Project Definition

![](../images/flowchart_project.webp)

- Evaluate the legal constraints, obtain permission
- Defining the coordinate system:
  - Dependent on the desired coordinate system of the final data
  - Consistent with the coordinate system of GCP survey

---

## Flight planning

![](../images/flowchart_planning.webp)

- Mission area assessment
- Planning geometric parameters
- Choosing flight planning and flight logging platform
- Preliminary weather assessment (climate, season, forecasts)
- Creating a flight plan (software specific)

---

## Placing Ground Control Points (GCPs) { .smaller }

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- A **minimum number** of **5 GCPs** is recommended.
- 5 to 10 GCPs are usually enough, even for large projects.
- In cases that the topography of the area is complex, use more GCPs
- The GCPs should be **distributed evenly** in the area
- **Do not place** the GCPs exactly at the **edges** of the area

## Placing Ground Control Points (GCPs)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Before measuring the GCPs coordinates, the following items must be defined:

- GCP coordinate system
- GCP accuracy
- Topographic equipment (total station or hand held GPS?)

## GCPs Accuracy {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Factors for defining GCP accuracy:

- Accuracy needed for the final results
- Ground Sampling Distance* of the images:
  - GCP target size: 5-10 x
  - GCP accuracy: at least 0.1 GSD

*Distance between two consecutive pixel centers measured on the ground*

## Ground Sampling Distance {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Distance between two consecutive pixel centers measured on the ground:

The formula to calculate GSD is:

$$
\text{GSD} = \frac{\text{A} \times \text{S}}{\text{F} \times \text{D}}
$$

Where:

- A: Flight Altitude (m)
- S: Sensor(hight, width) (mm)
- F: Focal Length (mm)
- D: Image Dimensions (height, width) (pixels)

**Bigger GSD** = lower spatial resolution \
**Smaller GSD** = higher spatial resolution

## Site evaluation and checklists {.smaller}

![](../images/flowchart_site.webp)

- Terrain check – high obstacles in the take-off, mission, landing, and alternative landing locations
- Ask the locals about possible air traffic or ground activities
- **Weather check**
  - Temperature affects battery life
  - Most of the UAS can’t operate in rain
- Use checklists, don't rely on your memory!
    - Sample checklists: [paper (for Phantom)](https://phantompilots.com/attachments/drone-checklist-pdf.41608/) and [RMUS app](https://www.rmus.com/pages/rmus-uav-pilot-preflight-compliance-checklist)

## Site evaluation and checklists

![](../images/site.webp)

---

## Site evaluation and checklists {.smaller}

**Preflight inspection is required under Part 107.49;** \

**Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC)** is required to develop a **preflight inspection checklist** if the manufacturer has not developed one.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

[NCDOT Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program](https://www.ncdot.gov/divisions/aviation/uas/Pages/default.aspx)

- The checklist is usually integrated into the UAS flight software or can be obtained from the UAS vendor
- In case that is not available, a standard Flight Checklist should be made and followed by the flight crew

> Note: As of Dec. 1, 2024, North Carolina no longer require commercial and government drone operators to obtain an N.C. permit

---

## Flight control {.smaller}

![](../images/flowchart_control.webp)

- The UAS RPIC should **launch, operate, and recover** from **preset locations** so that the aircraft will fly according to the mission plan.
- **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)** - the flight crew should have a clear view of the aircraft at all times, called . 
- Observation locations should be selected for the **maximum line of sight** throughout the planned flight operations area (Part 107.31).

---

## Flight control {.smaller}

![](../images/flowchart_control.webp)

- **RP (Remote Pilot)**, **PMC (Person Manipulating the Flight Controls)**, and **VO (Visual Observer)** (if used)
    - must be able to maintain effective communication with each other at all times (Part 107.33).
- Upon any failure during the flight or any loss of visual contact with the UAS, the RPIC should command the aircraft back to the recovery location or utilize the built-in fail-safe features to recover the aircraft.
