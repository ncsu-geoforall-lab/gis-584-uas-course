## Outline

- Motivation for combining lidar and UAS SfM data
- Analysis of lidar and UAS SfM DSMs differences
- Patching and smooth fusion of UAS and lidar DSM
- Overland flow simulation on fused DEM

## Point Clouds from Lidar {.smaller}

- Measured variable is the time of return for each pulse
- Georeferencing is based on the position (measured by GPS) and exterior orientation (measured by inertial navigation system INS) of the platform
- (x, y, z) is derived from time, GPS positioning, and INS parameters

![Point cloud visualization from Lidar](../images/midpines_lidar_plasviewcozoom.webp)

## Point Clouds from SfM {.smaller}

- Measured variable is reflected energy captured as imagery
- Georeferencing can be done entirely from GCPs
- (x, y, z) is derived from overlapping images and GCPs
- Alternatively: GPS and INS for the position and orientation of images and camera parameters

## Comparison of Point Cloud Properties {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
#### Airborne Lidar:
- Passes through vegetation, multiple returns
- Shifts between swaths, corduroy effect
- Regional coverage
- High cost
:::
::: {.column width=50%}
#### UAS SfM:
- Very high point density
- Limited capability to map under vegetation
- Influenced by cast shadows
- Low cost but limited area
:::
:::

Different distribution of errors and distortions:  
Lidar and SfM provide an independent set of measurements.

## Motivation for Lidar and UAS SfM Fusion

- Low-cost DEM updates in rapidly changing landscapes (e.g., construction sites)
- Replacing vegetated areas in UAS SfM with bare ground
- Watershed analysis when only part of the watershed was mapped by UAS
- Improve accuracy and level of detail over stable features (buildings, bridges)
- Add your suggestion

## Fusion Techniques

- Merge the point clouds, decimate or bin at high resolution, interpolate: computationally demanding
- Interpolate DEMs, randomly sample, patch, and reinterpolate: loss of detail, time-consuming
- Interpolate DEMs and patch: sharp edges
- Smooth fusion - requires DEMs at the same resolution

## Workflow

- Evaluate the point clouds, select resolution
- Interpolate lidar and UAS DEMs at the same resolution
- Evaluate the differences between the lidar and UAS DEMs
- If applicable, identify errors and apply corrections
- Apply smooth fusion

## Identify Distortions Due to Processing {.smaller}

- Identify the spatial pattern of distortions
- Difference maps between Lidar DSM and UAS SfM DSMs

## Comparing Profiles: Fields

- Identify systematic errors (vertical shifts)
- Differences due to vegetation growth, erosion/deposition

![Profiles Comparison Fields](../images/Anna_profile_fields.webp)

## Comparing Profiles: Building

- High accuracy, lower level of detail in lidar data
- Negligible systematic error

![Profiles Comparison Building](../images/Anna_profile_house.webp)

## Comparing Profiles: Road

- Relatively easy to identify stable features
- High accuracy - differences between lidar and UAS SfM within 4cm

![Profiles Comparison Road](../images/subregion_road_profile_2.webp)

## Correct for Systematic Error and Distortions {.smaller}

- Systematic error: if due to GPS shift, use median difference
- Systematic error: if tilt, use regression function
- Complex UAS SfM distortions can be reduced using interpolated GCP differences or differencing with lidar
- Importance of well-distributed, accurate GCPs

## Updating Lidar DEM by Patching {.smaller}

- Replace the grid cells in the updated area by UAS DEM
- Average over an overlap
- Usually creates an edge - requires post-processing

Linear combination of elevation surfaces $z_{A}$ and $z_{B}$ with weights given by overlap width $s$ and distance $d$ to the edge of $z_{A}$:

$$
z_{AB} = z_{A} w + z_{B}(1 - w),
\\[10pt]
w = f(s, d) =
\begin{cases} 
  \frac{d}{s} & 0 \leq d < s \\
  1 & d \geq s

## Influence of Overlap Width $s$

## Fusion with Spatially Variable $s$ {.smaller}

By taking into account spatially variable differences  $\Delta z$ between DEMs $A$ and $B$ along the overlap:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
- We get a more gradual transition where differences are high
- We preserve subtle features of both DEMs where differences are small

## Fusion with Spatially Variable $s$

Absolute elevation difference between lidar and UAS DEM controls the width of the transition overlap.

## Spatially Variable Overlap {.smaller}

![Spatial Overlap](../images/assignment_overlap.webp)

Bare ground UAS DSM is used to update lidar bare ground DEM using spatially variable overlap

## Modeling Overland Flow

Microtopography captured at ultra-high resolution by UAS SfM poses special challenges to flow routing:

- Real depressions are important features
- Complex pattern of ponding, overflow of barriers is not supported by standard tools
- Noisy surface requires a robust algorithm

## Path Sampling Method

Stochastic method for solving flow continuity equations
