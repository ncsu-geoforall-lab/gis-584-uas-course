## Outline
- Compare survey data and errors from different flights
- Recognize differences in geoprocessing products generated by different softwares
- Understand significance of using GCPs in the processing and their impact on the final products
- Recognize what processing steps need to be modified in order to improve particular errors
- Understand what causes the 'Bowl effect' and know the solutions to fix it
- Execute distance, area and volume measurements
