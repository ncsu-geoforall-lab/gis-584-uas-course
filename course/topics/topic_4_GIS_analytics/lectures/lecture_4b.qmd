## Outline

- Characteristics of UAS and lidar-based point cloud data
- Point cloud data processing, visualization, and analysis
- Computing DEM / DSM, and topographic parameters
- Voxel-based analysis and vertical profiles

## What are point clouds?

- Dense set of points (x,y,z) defined in 3D space:
  - Directly measured using lidar
  - Derived from overlapping images using SfM (see previous lectures)

## Lidar point cloud acquisition {.smaller}

- Measured time of pulse return is converted to distance
- Georeferencing is based on the position (measured by GPS) and exterior orientation (measured by inertial navigation system INS) of the platform

Lidar pulse can penetrate the tree canopy leading to multiple pulse returns

- Binary LAS format (header, record information, x,y,z,i, ... ), industry lidar data exchange format
- Compressed LAZ format
- Proprietary formats, especially for waveform data

## Point cloud data processing

- Preview and analysis of point distribution
- Filtering outliers
- Bare earth point extraction
- Classification: canopy, buildings ...
- Decimation (point cloud thinning)
- Transformation to surfaces or 3D objects


## Analysis of point distribution

Binning: point statistics for each grid cell at selected resolution

- Number of points per grid cell - map of point densities
- Range, stddv of z-values - map of within cell vertical variability
- Identify data gaps, potential for artifacts
- Use to select appropriate supported resolution for DEM

## Analysis of point distribution: lidar

Increased densities along swath overlaps or close to terrestrial station position

*Midpines z-range lidar and UAS, lidar provides better data about the trees than the denser UAS point cloud*

## Outliers {.smaller}

- Lidar: birds, particles, material properties
- SfM: errors in point matching
- Filtered by using local z-min, z-max or range thresholds

![](../images/lid2013_793016_1ret_3ft.webp){height=310}

*Centennial Parkway - outlier present even in processed data*

## Bare ground and feature extraction {.smaller}

- Multiple returns help but not necessary
- Feature or surface needs to be sampled by sufficient number of points
- Multiscale curvature-based algorithm by Evans and Hudak
- Progressive morphological filter by Zhang

![](../images/mcc_default_smaller.webp){height=250}

*Midpines: above ground point cloud from lidar by MCC in GRASS*

## Decimation {.smaller}

- Thinning of point cloud - subsampling
- Reduces the point cloud size - easier to manage data
- Thinning threshold should be based on features that need to be preserved
- Count-based decimation: preserves variations in density
- Grid-based decimation: removes variations in density
- Distance and geometry based decimation: more computationally intensive

## Decimation: count-based

![](../images/decimation_secref_full.webp){height=350}
![](../images/decimation_secref_preserve_3.webp){height=350}

*Preserves relative point densities*

## Decimation: grid-based

![](../images/decimation_secref_full.webp){height=350}
![](../images/decimation_secref_grid_10.webp){height=350}

*Removes variations in point densities*

## Computing DEM: binning

- Per cell statistics: mean, min, max, or nearest point z-value
- Sufficient for many applications
- No need to import the points, on-fly raster generation
- May be noisy, with no-data areas

## Computing DEM: TIN

Meshes are standard in 3D engineering and design systems:

- Variable resolution based on terrain complexity
- Variable level of detail visualization
- 2D triangulation leads to TIN geometry not optimal for 3D, e.g. triangles on roads, artificial dams in valleys
- Harder to combine with other geospatial data
- Limited analytics available
- Harder to share - limited exchange formats

## Computing DEM: interpolation to raster

- Supports resolution higher than point density
- Results depend on the method used, but most methods work because of high point densities
- High resolution raster DEMs can be massive - works for most analytics, converts to TIN for 3D visualization
- Easy to share

## Topographic analysis

Deriving topographic parameters from point cloud based DEMs has challenges:

- DEMs are often noisy and parameters can reflect noise or scan pattern rather than actual topography
- High resolution leads to representation of landforms by 10s or 100s of points or grid cells
- Standard topographic analysis using 3x3 neighborhood leads to noisy patterns of topographic parameters or bias towards point distribution pattern

## Topographic analysis using splines {.smaller}

Simultaneous computation of parameters with interpolation

- Parameters derived from original points rather than raster
- Explicit equations for partial derivatives: RST
- Tens or hundreds of points can be used
- Tuning the level of detail by tension and smoothing parameters
