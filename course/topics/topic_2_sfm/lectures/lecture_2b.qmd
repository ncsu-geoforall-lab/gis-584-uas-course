## Objectives

- **Understand** the photogrammetric data processing as a multistep process;
- **Indicate** data needed for orthophoto/DTM generation from aerial imagery;
- **Understand** the difference between interior and exterior orientation of the photo;
- **Describe** the workflow of geoprocessing of aerial imagery in designated software (Agisoft Metashape Professional);

## UAS data 

### What do we get after the flight mission?

![](../images/uas_data.webp)

---

## Digital imagery

![](../images/digital_imagery.webp)

- usually on the camera SD card
- can be geotagged (depends on camera)
    - Camera lens location is "written into" each photo's EXIF file
    - this is not necessarily the case...

---

## Flight log

- Onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) accurately measures the orientation of airborne sensors,
- Information is logged into a text file (flight log),
- Contains elements of exterior orientation (EO, more [later in the lecture](./2017_Imagery_Processing.html#/18))

![](../images/log.webp){ width=80% }

---

## GCP coordinates

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Measured by GPS coordinates of the panels set before the flight
- Photo ID points (distinguishable ground features) can be surveyed later on 
- It is important to know the GCPs coordinate system (spatial reference system)

## Spatial reference system {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS is related to real places on the earth
- It is crucial to know what is your data reference system!

::: 
::: {.column width="50%"}

![](../images/projection.webp){ width=60% }

::: 
::: 

- There are global map projections, but most map projections are created and optimized to project smaller areas of the earth’s surface
- There are two different types of coordinate reference systems: Geographic Coordinate Systems and Projected Coordinate Systems
- [Spatial reference list (EPSG codes for coordinate reference systems)](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/)

## Digital Surface Model {.smaller}



- **DEM/DTM - Digital Elevation Model / Digital Terrain Model**
    - Representation of a terrain's elevation
    - Bare-earth raster grid
- **DSM - Digital Surface Model**

## Pointcloud

- Representation of the external surface of an object
- Set of vertices in a three-dimensional coordinate system

## Multiple-view geometry

- **Scene geometry (structure):**  
  Given 2D point matches in two or more images, where are the corresponding points in 3D?
- **Correspondence (stereo matching):**  
  Given a point in just one image, how does it constrain the position of the corresponding point in another image?
- **Camera geometry (motion):**  
  Given a set of corresponding points in two or more images, what are the camera matrices for these views?

---

## What do we need?

1. Digital **imagery**;
2. (Digital elevation model or topographic dataset);
3. Exterior **orientation parameters** from aerial triangulation or IMU;
4. (Camera calibration report);
5. (Ground Control Points parameters);
6. Photogrammetric **processing software** that utilizes collinearity equations.

**Accuracy**

---

## Building dense point cloud {.smaller}

At the stage of dense point cloud generation, Agisoft calculates depth maps for every image

- Quality: **Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lower** > the higher quality, the more accurate camera position estimates, but the process is more time-consuming

## Building dense point cloud {.smaller}

### Depth Filtering modes

Algorithms sorting outliers (due to some factors, like poor texture of some elements of the scene, noisy or badly focused images)

- **Mild** depth filtering mode > for **complex geometry** (numerous small details on the foreground), for important features not to be sorted out
- **Aggressive** depth filtering mode > sorting out most of the outliers
- **Moderate** depth filtering mode > results in between the Mild and Aggressive

## Generating texture {.smaller}

::: {.columns}

![](../images/texture.webp){ width=80% }

::: 
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Texture mapping modes:**
  - Generic
  - Adaptive orthophoto
  - Orthophoto
  - Spherical
  - Single photo
  - Keep uv

::: 
::: 

---

## Texture mapping modes {.smaller}

### Generic

- Creates as uniform texture as possible

### Adaptive orthophoto

- The object surface split into the flat part and vertical regions
- The flat part of the surface textured using the orthographic projection, 
  while vertical regions textured separately to maintain accurate texture representation in such regions
- More compact texture representation for nearly planar scenes + good texture quality 
  for vertical surfaces

---

## Texture mapping modes {.smaller}

#### Orthophoto

- The whole object surface textured in the orthographic projection
- Even more compact texture representation than the Adaptive orthophoto at
  the expense of texture quality in vertical regions

#### Spherical

- Only for objects that have a ball-like form

#### Single photo

- Texture from a single photo (photo can be selected from 'Texture from' list)

#### Keep uv

- Generates texture atlas using current texture parametrization; Rebuilding current texture with different resolution or generating
  the atlas parametrized in the external software

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](../images/build_DEM.webp)

::: 
::: {.column width="50%"}

### Parameters {.smaller}

- **Source data:** Dense point cloud
- **Interpolation**
  - Disabled: leads to accurate reconstruction results since only areas corresponding to dense point cloud points are reconstructed
  - Enabled (recommended): Interpolation mode - Agisoft will calculate DEM for all areas of the scene that are visible on at least one image.

## Generating orthophoto {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](../images/build_ortho.webp){ width=70% }

:::

### Parameters

- **Surface:** DEM
- **Blending mode**
  - Mosaic (default): Implements an approach with data division into several frequency domains, which are blended independently
  - Average: Uses the weighted average value of all pixels from individual photos
  - Disabled: The color value for the pixel is taken from the photo with the camera view being almost along the normal to the reconstructed surface in that point.
