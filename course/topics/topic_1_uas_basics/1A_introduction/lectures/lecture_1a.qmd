## UAS or UAV? Or maybe a drone?

::: {.incremental}
- **UAV** = Unmanned Aerial Vehicle

## Sensors {.center .text-center}
![](../images/uav_sensors2.webp)

## UAS sensors for mapping

- RGB cameras
- Infrared sensors
- Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors
- Laser scanners
- Thermal sensors

## RGB (natural color) cameras {.smaller}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Most common payload for consumer-grade UAS
- Photo or video mode
- Mapping (orthophoto and DSM generation) possible even with non-photogrammetric cameras
- Variety of cameras, lenses, and mounting systems - some suitable for 3D modeling

:::

## Multispectral and hyperspectral cameras {.smaller}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Miniaturization is challenging in terms of optics and sensor calibration
- Weight, cost, data quality has improved; spectral bands, resolution need improvements
- Cameras with NIR band: agriculture and vegetation mapping (for NDVI)
- The more bands the more information, but also higher price of the sensor
    - $$ multispectral - couple thousands
    - $$$ hyperspectral - tens of thousands

## Active sensors - LiDAR and SAR {.smaller}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Active sensors can reach below-canopy ground surface
- Large trade-offs between performance and size or cost of LiDAR
- LiDAR now common on UAS thanks to miniaturization
- SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) used experimentally, still faces challenges in adaptation to UAS

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Volume, size, and weight specifications
- Specific application requirements
- Mounting: integrated by manufacturer or custom solutions
- **The sensors must be adapted to the carrier and vice versa**

Regulations, standards, policies, and procedures

## Know before you fly {.text-center}

- [“Know Before You Fly”](https://knowbeforeyoufly.org/) is an educational campaign that provides prospective unmanned aircraft users with the information and guidance they need to fly safely and responsibly.
- Different rules apply to [recreational](https://knowbeforeyoufly.org/recreational/) and [business](https://knowbeforeyoufly.org/commercial/) users and [government entities](https://knowbeforeyoufly.org/government-entities/)
- New regulations (effective on August 29, 2016) known as [“Part 107”](https://youtu.be/v-d1RuTFvbs)
