:::

## Objectives

::: {.incremental}
- **Know** operating rules for commercial use of UAS (Part 107)
- **Recognize** permanent and temporary "no-drone-zones" and knows where to find information about them
- **Understand** the role of Certificate of Authorization and the process of obtaining it
- **Recognize** when the educational use of UAS can be classified as recreational and when commercial
:::

## Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Created in 1958 in response to a series of fatal accidents and midair collisions involving commercial aircraft
- Mandated to develop plans and policies for the use of navigable airspace to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace
- Since the creation of the FAA, American airspace has become one of the most regulated fields in the United States
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

:::
:::


## National Airspace System (NAS)

::: {.incremental}
- Already congested with piloted aircraft, and adding a swarm of UAVs requires thoughtful planning
- Main mandate: to ensure that UASs do not endanger current users of the NAS (including manned or other unmanned aircraft) nor compromise the safety of the people and property on the ground
- The lack of detect-sense-and-avoid capability of the current UAS technology is a major concern for the FAA
:::


## Types of UAS operations

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- FAA distinguishes 3 main types of operations
- Different rules apply for legal operations of UAS depending on the type of UAS operations
- Additional type - **educational use** can be considered as recreational or commercial

## Recreational use of UAS {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

## Public Entities {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Publicly funded university, law enforcement agency, fire department, or any other federal or state government agency have  
**TWO OPTIONS:**

- Follow the same requirements and operating rules for business users (known as **“Part 107”**)

**OR**

- Operate UAS for a government entity outside of these rules, you may apply for a blanket public **Certificate of Authorization (COA)**
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../images/public.webp)
:::
:::

## Certificate of Authorization

::: {.incremental}
**Can be obtained:**
- Only by government entities – such as federal and state government agencies, law enforcement agencies, and public colleges and universities
- Only for public (governmental) UAS aircraft operations

**Allows:**
- Flights at or below 400 feet in Class G airspace nationwide
- Self-certification of the UAS pilot
- The ability to obtain emergency COAs under special circumstances
:::

## Certificate of Authorization

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- COAs are issued for a specific period of time, usually two years
- Include special provisions unique to each proposal, such as a defined block of airspace and time of day sUAS can be used

## How to apply for COA?

::: {.incremental}
- Since 2009, the FAA has taken steps to streamline the application process by transitioning online
- Visit the [FAA website](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/coa/) for more information on how to apply for a COA online
- The average COA processing time is less than 60 days
- Expedited authorization is available in emergency and life-threatening situations
- [Sample COA Application](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/media/COA%20Sample%20Application%20v%201-1.pdf)

## Educational use {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- New legal interpretation from the FAA (May 5, 2016), the use of UAS by students in accredited education institutions as part of their coursework will be allowed under **recreational guidelines for model aircraft**
- This **does not apply** to research efforts, which would too closely link operation of the UAS to faculty members’ professional duties and compensation

## UAS best practices {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- If you can, tell other people you’ll be taking pictures or video of them before you do so
- If someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, don’t violate it by taking pictures or video, unless you’ve got a very good reason
- Don’t fly over other people’s private property without permission if you can easily avoid doing so

## UAS best practices {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Don’t gather personal data for no reason, and don’t keep it for longer than you have to
- If you keep sensitive data about other people, secure it against loss or theft
