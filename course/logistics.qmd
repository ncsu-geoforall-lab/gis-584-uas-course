### Course website and Moodle

The course material can be accessed on the [Schedule](schedule.qmd) web page.  
Course Forum, assignment submissions, project material, and grades are handled in [Moodle]({{< var course_params.moodle_link >}}).

### Lectures

- Focus of lectures is on principles, theory, concepts, methods and lectures are mostly software independent.
- Lecture slides and video are available at each topic's web page - you can access them through **Schedule** or Moodle.
- Topics webpages also include links to addition reading and other resources.
- [NCSU Panopto: Fall 2024 Letcure Recordings]({{< var course_params.panopto_link >}})

### Assignments

- Most topics include hands-on assignment - the links to assignments are provided at each topic's web page - you can access them through the course [schedule](schedule.qmd).
- Following the Schedule, you will submit a brief (2 pages minimum, including images and tables) paper for each topic with the following paragraphs:
  - **Introduction**: task, problem
  - **Methods**: general description of methods and concepts
  - **Results**: present the results, including maps, graphs, tables with comments
  - **Discussion**: was there anything unexpected or problematic in the results? Were there any issues related to the methodology or software? Include suggestions for improvements here.
  - **Conclusion**: 1-2 sentences on what you have learned
- Submit your report through Moodle in pdf format, use naming convention `LastnameFirstname_HW#.pdf`.

### Software

- [GRASS GIS {{< var software.grass.version >}}]({{< var software.grass.website >}}) (you can use [these instructions to install it](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/logistics.html#software))
- [Agisoft Metashape]({{< var software.agisoft.website >}}) (provided at NCSU) - you can work on the demo version.
- [OpenDroneMap](http://opendronemap.org/)

- Processed data:
  - [Mid Pines dataset (formatted as GRASS location): LakeWheeler_NCspm](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXNXVpOEdyejlpbEE) with timeseries of DSMs from 2015 flights

    - [Point clouds for the gully area at Midpines](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXSDdSZGpJSktXM3c) (high density, from 2015 flights)

#### Lidar data

- [Classified lidar point cloud in LAS format for Mid_Pines](http://fatra.cnr.ncsu.edu/uav-lidar-analytics-course/mid_pines_spm_2013.las)
- [Secref and Mid Pines interpolated DEM/DSM (use r.unpack)](http://fatra.cnr.ncsu.edu/uav-lidar-analytics-course/secref_mid_pines_spm_elev.zip)

#### Orthophotography

- [Orthophotos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1AfQGDB8tPXd05tSTVLZUZBd00) as GRASS GIS packed rasters, use r.unpack from within the LakeWheeler_NCspm location to import them, run it with -o to override projection (it is just a different EPSG for HARN versus NAD83 datum, the difference is negligible)
