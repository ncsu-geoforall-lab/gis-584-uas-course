The focus of this project is on the analysis of UAS data rather than the data collection process itself. You are not required to collect your own UAS data; however, the dataset you use must be sourced from UAS data. Alternatively, your project could involve enhancing some aspect of UAS data collection, such as flight planning or Structure from Motion (SfM).

#### Available Data Sources:

- Lake Wheeler (NCSU) - Agricultural Land: A dataset we will provide.
-  Utilize Open Data Sources
    - [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets?search=uav)
- Collect Your Own Data: Optionally, you may choose to collect your own UAS data.

## Proposal, presentation and paper requirements

### Pre-Proposal

- Submit a project pre-proposal to the [project discussion forum]({{< course_params.moodle_project_pre_proposal_link >}}) on Moodle.

In the pre-proposal please define the scope of the project, the project location, data, and analysis you would like to perform.

### Proposal

- Define research question, select location, list available data, methods (theory), software tools, describe expected results.

[Submit to Moodle]({{< course_params.moodle_project_proposal_link >}})

### Presentation

- Length: DE students 10 minutes, on-campus students 15 min + 5 min discussion
- Introduction/background: problem, motivation for the research, research question / objective
- Study site: where, why this site, geographic characteristics
- Data acquisition: platform and sensor, flight plan (if applicable), flight conditions
- Data properties and processing: resolution, spatial extent, accuracy
- Analysis and/or modeling methods: describe methodology and workflows
- Results: present and explain the results using qualitative and quantitative description, tables, graphs, maps/images
- Discussion: discuss impact of flight conditions, data and methods on the results, uncertainty issues, compare with results from other studies, which questions remain unresolved, what still needs to be done
- Conclusion: summary of the most important findings including advances in methodology, future work

### Paper

- Structure and formatting should follow scientific journal standards.
- Same sections as the presentation
- Text and Figures: min. 4 pages, single spaced including tables and references images, maps, graphs, presented in readable size with scale and legends where needed
- References: at least 5 papers from scientific journals, rest can be reports, web documents
- Appendix (optional): workflows, scripts, metadata. Software commands, issues go here
